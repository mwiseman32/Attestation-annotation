## 1. Introduction
- This is a sample verifier application which provides the simple http client -server connection between client and verifier and 
- gets the client systems information as hostname ip date and time
- runs quote operation on client and sends results over to verifier 
- verifier is a serverside which checks the quote with quotecheck operation 
## 2. Future work
- this is actual work in progress to make a verifier server connected to database or link it with hirs setup
